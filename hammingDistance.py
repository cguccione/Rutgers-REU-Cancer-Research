'''
This program monitors mutations and thier progression over time

Input:
3 TRF files from the same paitent at diffrent estimates

Output:
A matrix with the changes across muatations reflected that
can then be created into a tree

*This program uses hamming distance, or just simply if the
mutation is present or absent in order to track mutations.
In the future things such as the type of mutation and depth
may be taken into account.
